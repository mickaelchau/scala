// Assignment name: Implement the gradient of a binary funciton
//
// This homework assignment accompanies section "Convergence".
// The test cases can be found in the file GradientTestSuite.scala
// You should complete the function, replacing ??? with correct Scala
// code so that the tests pass.

  def gradient(f:(Double,Double)=>Double, delta:Double, test:(Double,Double)=>Boolean,x:Double,  y:Double): (Double,Double) = {
    val fx = f(x,_) // a function of y
    val fy = f(???,???) // a function of x
    val partialWRTx = derivative(???,???,???) _ // function of x
    val partialWRTy = derivative(???,???,???) _ // function of y

    // now the return value as a tuple
    (???,???)
