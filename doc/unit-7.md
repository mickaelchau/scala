# Unit 7 -- Object orientation

In this lecture we will develop a Scala program to manipulate graphs and trees.

The idea of this lecture is to learn as we go.  Rather than lecturing
on lots of disjoint topics, we will implement an application, and talk
about the concepts as we need them.  The small program will cover the
following topics:

- Classes and case classes
- Inheritance
- ADT, Algebraic Data Types
- Singleton objects
- Polymorphism
- Printed representation of objects
- Overriding operators such as `++` e.g., `a ++ b`
- `this` vs `that`
- Pattern matching of objects
- Testing your code incrementally
- Make instance of a class callable, `apply`
