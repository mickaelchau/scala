## Copy the homework template file

Make sure to go a `git pull` as necessary.  The homework file will have a name such as `Something.scala` you
should copy this file from `src/mail/templates` into your `src/main/scala/homework` directory of
your project without renaming, so that it is visible to IntelliJ and
to the Scala compiler.  You must also copy the test case file named `SomethingTestSuite.scala` from
the `src/test/waiting` directory to the `src/test/scala` directory.


You may copy the files simply from your OS (Linux, MacOS, etc),
or you can use the file browser in IntelliJ.

Find the file to copy.
